# Sonic Robo Blast 2 Crowd Control

# Setup

Load the Sonic Robo Blast 2 Effect Pack in the Crowd Control app and set the path to your executable.
Once you are ingame, load the Crowd Control pk3 and the game should automatically try to connect.
Note that most effects will only work when in a map.

# How to make the PK3

Open the SL_CrowdControl folder with [SLADE](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=downloads) and use the `Archive -> Build Archive` option to export it as a PK3.
